AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a <script> tag.


AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.



The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.



AngularJS starts automatically when the web page has loaded.

The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

The ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.




angular init
-----------------

The ng-init directive initializes AngularJS application variables.



<div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='John'">

<p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName"></span></p>

</div>


AngularJS Applications
--------------------------

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.

Angular js expressions
-----------------------

AngularJS expressions can contain literals, operators, and variables.
 AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.
 AngularJS expressions do not support conditionals, loops, and exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.
AngularJS expressions support filters, while JavaScript expressions do not.

Angular js Modules
---------------------
An AngularJS module defines an application.

The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

The module is a container for the application controllers.

Controllers always belong to a module
